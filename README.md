# mongo-mongoose-camo-on-node

This will serve as a playground for mongodb with examples of running different basic mongo operations using 3 approaches:
1. Native Mongo driver;
2. Mongoose;
3. Camo;

Node version manipulations on Windows were made based on: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

# TODO list:
1. Create initialisation script;
2. Cover all existing code with Integration tests;
3. Mirror all the logic with equivalent Mongoose code;
4. Mirror all the logic with equivalent Camo code;
